## How To:

## Pokemon Search and Search Bar

You can search for any of the 905 Pokemon dynamically via typing have the results change based on key word. When you hit the "Search button your keyord is saved in the "Search History", allowing you run the same search again via the "Retry" button.

For indication when you hover over a Pokemon it highlights orange, and when you click on

## Enhancements TODO and Complete:

1. Evolved Forms and Evolution Chain - Add the Pokemon Evolution as part of "Details" section

2. Creation of automation tests

3. Pagination - I opted for loading all 905 to simulate a collection instead of pagination the 20 Pokemon per API call. Wanted to showcase the Pokemon

4. Freeze "Search Bar" and the resulting Pokemon scroll underneath

5. More design work to make the app look even more like a Pokedex...

## Learn More

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) TS template.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the app by Running:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
